# NodeBB Youtube Lite Plugin

The Youtube Lite plugin now supports v3 of Youtubes API, this means you will need an API key. Find out more about that further down this document. 
Youtube Lite allows you to lazyload youtube videos into your NodeBB Forum with no code knowledge on the users end. (Just paste any video URL)
